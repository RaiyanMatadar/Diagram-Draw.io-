Project: SmartHome_Manager


Category: Home Automation Management

Context:


This project will simulate a smart home management system where users can control and monitor virtual devices from one place. While no real-world integration will be involved, students will simulate device creation, management, and control workflows to mimic the behavior of a smart home.

Project Goal


Create a home management platform where users can add devices, configure their simulated features, set routines, monitor energy usage, and interact with appliances through a virtual dashboard.

Part 1: L1 - Minimum Expected Features


User Authentication and Household Setup
Allow users to register, log in, and set up a household.
Users create multiple rooms (e.g., Living Room, Bedroom) and assign devices to each room.
Example: After logging in, the user creates a “Bedroom” and assigns devices like a virtual thermostat and lamp to it.
Appliance Control Dashboard
Provide a dashboard that lists all devices and their current states (On/Off, Temperature, etc.).
Example: On the dashboard, the user sees that the fan is off and the thermostat is set to 24°C, with options to change settings.
Routine Scheduling System
Simulate routines like turning off lights at midnight or lowering the thermostat at 8 AM.
Example: The user creates a routine that turns off all lights and fans in the house at 10 PM.
Simulated Energy Usage Tracking
Track how long appliances were "used" and show a report on simulated energy consumption.
Example: The user checks the dashboard and finds that the air conditioner has consumed 30 kWh of simulated energy over the past week.
Alerts for Device Malfunctions
Simulate malfunction alerts for devices with abnormal usage patterns.
Example: If the heater remains on for more than 24 hours, the app sends a warning recommending the device be reset.
Part 2: L2 - Unique Features


Stimulating Device Management System**
A. **Simulated Device Creation**
- Users can **create devices** under their account, each with its own simulated features.
- **Example**: The user creates a new device called “Smart Lamp” with configurable features like brightness control (0-100%) and color mode (Warm/Cold), with `On/Off` button and Connect `Button`
- Another Device like `Ceiling Fan` whose features like `3 speed control`,

B. **Configurable Features Per Device**
- Each device will have **unique attributes** such as operational modes, thresholds, or settings.
- **Example**:
- A **Thermostat** allows users to set temperature limits (18°C to 30°C).
- A **Fan** includes speed settings (Low, Medium, High).
- A **Lamp** offers dimmer control and color selection.

C. **Simulated Device Connection**
- After creating a device, users must **click a "Connect" button** to simulate linking the device with the app’s management system.
- **Example**: Once the user creates a “Smart AC,” they click "Connect," and the system shows the AC on the dashboard, ready to be controlled.

D. **Device Status and Feedback Simulation**
- Users can **monitor device statuses** such as whether they are "On," "In Standby," or "Malfunctioning."
- **Example**: If the virtual washing machine fails to respond, the system simulates a malfunction warning.

Challenging Features


Simulated Usage Prediction
Implement a prediction algorithm that learns usage patterns based on simulated logs.
Example: If the thermostat is adjusted every morning at 7 AM, the system suggests automating it for the same time daily.
Emergency Mode Simulation
Implement an emergency mode that triggers simulated actions like turning off all appliances.
Example: During emergency mode activation, the app displays that all appliances have been switched off and virtual doors are locked.
Simulated Voice Control Interface
Create a text-based voice command interface to simulate voice commands.
Example: The user types “Turn off all lights,” and the system responds by toggling all light devices off.
Simulated Device Role Management
Add a multi-user role system (Admin, Guest, Child). Different roles will have varying access to devices and settings.
Example: Guests can turn devices on/off, but only admins can change routines or delete devices.
Simulated Device Groups for Custom Control
Allow users to group devices to perform collective actions.
Example: A “Morning Routine” group turns on the coffee maker, lights, and TV simultaneously when activated.
Simulated Energy Efficiency Recommendations
Provide simulated energy-saving suggestions based on appliance usage patterns.
Example: The system recommends switching to a "sleep mode" routine at night to reduce the usage of unnecessary appliances.
